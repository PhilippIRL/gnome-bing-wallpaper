# Gnome Bing Wallpaper
##### Set [Bing](http://bing.com) image as your Linux wallpaper.
***
I like Bing images for my wallpaper. On Windows you can use 'Bing Desktop' application to set your daily wallpaper from bing but there is no such thing on Linux.

## Requirements
This script is written in python 3 so all you need is a version 3 of python with no external libraries. Also this script was initially written for [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org) DE but was changed to work with Gnome.

## Usage
All you need to do is running this command:
```shell
    python script.py
```
You can run this script on system startup to change your wallpaper on boot. Locale can be changed too from 'hpimagearchive_url' field.
